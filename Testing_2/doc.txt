specifications:
PORT -> defines the port on which the server will listen for incoming connections
example : 8888

HOST -> defines the host on which the server will listen for incoming connections
example : 10.10.3.4

inbound:
    -> it is nothing but the server which will listen for incoming connections
    -> it will be a TCP server(socket) which will listen for incoming connections
    -> uses the start_server() in asyncio to start the server

    -> it will recieve when any of the node tries to send some message to it
    -> types of data recieving
        -> simple verification
        -> data to be stored(chunked file)
    -> it might respond back simple verification or it might store the data too (file that is distributed across the network)

outbound:
    -> it is the client which will try to connect to the server of the other node to send the data
    -> it will be a TCP client(socket) which will try to connect to the server of the other node
    -> uses the open_connection() in asyncio to connect to the server of the other node

    -> it will send the data to the other node
    -> types of data sending
        -> simple verification
        -> data to be stored(chunked file)
    -> it might recieve the response back from the other node(like success or failure)
